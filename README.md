Objective: To understand how factors such as the company listed on the complaint, the channel filing the complaint, and the type of complaint impact the volume of complaints and the length of response times to promote customer satisfaction as a government agency


Guiding questions:
    - What are the current numbers of complaints and the average times to close the complaints? How have the volume of complaints and response times changed over time?
    - Which companies are associated with higher numbers of complaints and longer average times to close? What are specific complaint types that stand out to these issues for these companies?
    - How do the different filing channels impact the number of complaints and average time to close?
    - What seasonality trends are there within the higher volume of complaints or longer resolution times?
    - What are the distributions of complaints and resolution times?

Insights and recommendations: 
    1) State Farm has the highest volume of complaints.
        - Initiate a targeted review of State Farm's business practices, claims handling procedures, and customer service protocols to identify the root causes of the high complaint volume. This could involve audits, surveys of policyholders, and analysis of the specific types of complaints received.
    2) Aetna Life Insurance Company has the quickest complaint response rate.
        - Study Aetna's complaint handling processes to identify best practices in efficient resolution. These successful strategies could be shared with or mandated for other insurance companies to improve overall responsiveness within the industry.
    3) Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) have the longest average response time for complaints.
        - Implement specific regulations or guidelines for HMO complaint resolution timelines, potentially setting maximum allowable response days. Investigate the reasons for these delays, which could include complex approval processes or network issues, and consider interventions to streamline these processes.
